/**
 * Tool registry seam — the ONE place a tool domain is registered, and the one
 * place a tool name resolves to an implementation.
 *
 * Two layers, resolved base-first, then domains:
 *
 *   1. Base layer — the 26 MCP tools. It WRAPS the existing dispatch switch
 *      (surfaces/mcp/dispatch.ts) rather than reimplementing it: `run` delegates
 *      to `dispatchTool`, and name/description/inputSchema come from the
 *      checked-in tools/list snapshot. The switch stays the single
 *      implementation, so the control structure the parity harness guards is
 *      never retyped. dispatch.ts does not import this module, so the seam
 *      costs that file nothing — it stays untouched by every domain after this.
 *   2. Domain layer — additive ToolDomains from TOOL_DOMAINS below. Adding a
 *      domain means editing that one list: no switch edit, no snapshot edit.
 *
 * Unknown names keep the switch's own error text, byte-for-byte:
 * `unknown tool: ${name}`.
